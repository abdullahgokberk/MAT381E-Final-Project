    "\n",
    "I will use [this](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* PassengerId\n",
    "* Name- name of passengers\n",
    "* survival- 0 = No, 1 = Yes\n",
    "* pclass- 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd\n",
    "* sex- Sex of passengers\n",
    "* Age- Age in years\n",
    "* sibsp- # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic \n",
    "* parch- # of parents / children aboard the Titanic\n",
    "* ticket- Ticket number\n",
    "* fare- Passenger fare\n",
    "* cabin- Cabin number\n",
    "* embarked- C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use machine learning to build a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. I will do all the sub-titles of data preprocessing, data analysis, data visualization and model building myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware and Software\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use jupyter notebook. I haven't decided yet which machine learning technique I will use."
